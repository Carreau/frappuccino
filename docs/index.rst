Frappuccino
-----------

Freeze your API.

Frappuccino is a tool to help you determine what the changes of API in your
projects are and catch potential breaking changes. The goal is to not only
provide a continuous integration feature to fail in case of inadvertently
breaking API, but also to provide an easy way to list all those changes in
release notes. 


Real life example::

    $ source activate astropy-3.2
    $ frappuccino astropy astropy.timeseries --save    astropy.json

    $ source activate astropy-master
    $ frappuccino astropy astropy.timeseries --compare astropy.json

    The following signatures differ between versions:

        - astropy.time.core.TimeDelta.to(self, *args, **kwargs)
        + astropy.time.core.TimeDelta.to(self, unit, equivalencies='[]')

        - astropy.table.table.Table.add_column(self, col, index='None', name='None', rename_duplicate='False', copy='True')
        + astropy.table.table.Table.add_column(self, col, index='None', name='None', rename_duplicate='False', copy='True', default_name='None')

        - astropy.table.table.Table.replace_column(self, name, col)
        + astropy.table.table.Table.replace_column(self, name, col, copy='True')


To do so Frappuccino takes a snapshot of the API of your project at one point in
time and compare it with the API on the master version, and list the
differences.


Example::

    # old function
    def read(name, *, options=None):
        with open(name, 'rb') as f:
            return process(data)

    # new function
    def read(name_or_buffer, *, options=None):
        if isinstance(name, str):
            with open(name, 'rb') as f:
                data = f.read()
        else:
            data = name_or_buffer.read()
        return process(data)

There is a subtle breakage of API in the above, as you may not remember
positional parameters can be use a keyword arguments. That is to say one of your
users may be calling the function like so::

    read(name='dump.csv')

Hence changing the _name_ of the positional parameter from ``name`` to
``name_or_buffer`` is a change of API. There are a number of details like this
one where you _may_ end up breaking API without realizing. It's hard to keep
track of this when working on dev branches, unit test may not catch all of that.
Frappuccino is there to help.

Install
-------

Frappuccino is only available via PyPI, as a Python 3 wheel::

   pip install frappuccino


From source, using flit::

   pip install flit
   git clone https://github.com/carreau/frappuccino
   cd frappuccino
   flit install

For a developer install::

   flit install --symlink


How to use
----------


Using frappuccino is pretty straitforward:

   - make sure the previous version of your project library is importable. 
   - run ``frappuccino <import name> --save  somename.json``
   - make sure the new version of your project library is importable, and run
     with the ``--compare`` flag ``frappuccino <import name> --compare  somename.json``

See example at top of the page.


Another example to compare two files:: 

    cp frappuccino/tests/old.py
    frappuccino/t.py
    frappuccino frappuccino.t --save t.json;
    sleep 2;  # avoid python bytecode caching.
    cp frappuccino/tests/new.py frappuccino/t.py;
    frappuccino frappuccino.t --compare t.json


Codestyle
---------

Any color as long as it's black. isort imports. mypy does not complain too much. 
Any other linter appreciated as long as the issues can be automatically fixed.
The less discussion about it and the less frisson for the developer are good.


FAQ
===

Q: Should I commit the JSON files to my repositories to not have to rerun on
old versions of my projects ? 

A: I advise not to, the on-disk file format is not stable yet newer version of
Frappuccino might not understand it. 


Q: Why a CLI and not as python function/test plug-in

A: You usually need to run Frappuccino twice on two versions of the same library
, so usually you can't do that in process. 


Q: Results are wrong. 

A: Open an issue please. 

Q: It crashes. 

A: See "Results are wrong". 


Q: How can I use it in CI

A: Good question, I'm still thinking about it, in most CI you _should_ have
access to your VCS history, so checkout an old version and build it ? You can
also upload the .json results to a non URL and grab it. The return code is not
yet non-zero anyway as I haven't implemented all of the comparisons function
yet. 

Q: Why The name. 

A: API + Frozen = frAPpuccIno, it looks like a pun only I get, so please let it
go. 

Q: The logo is horrible. 
A: Do you have better design skills ?
